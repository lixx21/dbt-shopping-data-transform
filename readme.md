# Shopping Data Transformation with DBT

Welcome to the Shopping Data Transformation project! This project leverages DBT (Data Build Tool) to transform raw shopping data into a well-structured, analytics-ready format. The transformed data can be used for business intelligence, reporting, and data science workflows.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to implement a robust data transformation pipeline using DBT to process and refine shopping data. DBT enables modular, version-controlled, and testable data transformations that ensure accuracy and efficiency in data workflows.
